# Authorship-Identification-of-Bengali-Poetry-using-Machine-Learning-and-NLP

- This project tries to classify the author of a bengali poem based on poetic features.
- Poems of Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Sukanto Bhattacharya are collected by using Web Scraping.
- Feature extraction like TF-IDF, N-Gram, Countvectorizer for the poems.
- Classification models Na√Øve Bayes , SVM, Perceptron , Multi-layer perceptron , Random Forest Classifier and Bidirectional LSTM are used


**The poem dataset was provided by [Society For Natural Language Technology Research](https://nltr.org/)**

- The corpus was scraped from the website using python.
- Then the scraped data was preprocessed and labelling of each poem has been done manually. Label 1 for Sukanta Bhattacharya, Label 2 for Rabindranath Tagore, Label 3 for Kazi Nazrul Islam
